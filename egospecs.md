App name: "Ego"
Introducing ‚ÄúEgo‚Äù ‚Äî a bold new social auction platform where luxury meets competition.
Built for women of African descent all around the world who want to monetize attention, and wealthy
admirers ready to compete for it.
Unlike typical fan platforms, Ego turns attention into a live auction.
Multiple items ‚Äî be it digital content, live dates, personalized videos, or your most expensive hookup
experience‚Äî go up for bid. But there‚Äôs a twist:
üëâ Only the highest bid across all items wins.
This creates fierce competition, FOMO, and instant validation for both parties.
Think of it as social media meets luxury auction ‚Äî not for everyone, but perfect for women who know
their worth, and men who like to prove it.

6.3. Membership:
Only girls can open a creator account, whereas anyone can signup as a viewer. So when the become a
creator button is clicked they're prompted to do a gender-based face-scan.
To build a gender-based face-scan authentication system that controls access to specific registration
forms in your app, you'll need to combine face detection, gender classification, and conditional UI
routing. Here's a high-level roadmap and the tools you can use:
üîß 1. Face Scan & Gender Detection
You‚Äôll need a lightweight on-device or server-based model that can:
Detect a face from the camera.
Predict the gender (e.g., male or female).
Return that gender info to your app for access control.
üîç Options:
A. Use Pre-trained Gender Detection Models
TensorFlow.js / MediaPipe (for client-side browser or mobile face + gender recognition).
Face API.js (JS library with face detection + age/gender estimation).
DeepFace (Python library ‚Äì runs server-side with models like VGG-Face, FaceNet, etc.).
B. Example Flow (Client-side with Face API.js):
// Using face-api.js
await faceapi.nets.tinyFaceDetector.loadFromUri('/models');
await faceapi.nets.ageGenderNet.loadFromUri('/models');
const result = await faceapi.detectSingleFace(videoEl, new
faceapi.TinyFaceDetectorOptions()).withAgeAndGender();
const gender = result.gender; // "male" or "female"
üß† 2. Handle Access Logic Based on Gender
Once gender is detected:
If gender === "female": Route to full registration form.
If gender === "male": Show limited form or message (or vice versa, depending on your logic).
üîí 3. Add Security & Consent
This is critical to protect users and stay compliant:
Show a consent prompt before scanning (e.g., "We use face analysis to verify eligibility for
registration. Do you consent?").
Store only the gender result, not the face image, unless the user explicitly allows.
Consider adding spoof protection (e.g., liveness check like blinking).
üì≤ 4. App Integration Strategy
Choose based on your platform:
iOS/Android
ML Kit, MediaPipe, TensorFlow Lite


--- PAGE 4 ---

Backend API
Python (FastAPI + DeepFace or OpenCV)
‚úÖ Example Flow Summary:
User opens the app ‚Üí hits "Join Now."
App asks for camera access ‚Üí runs gender scan.
Based on gender result:
Female ‚Üí Creator form.
Male ‚Üí Viewership form.
Store result securely (not the face image).
Proceed with registration.
Limit creator account by nationality (only African countries)
7. Performance Optimization
Lightweight Assets:
Optimized code and assets for quick loading and mobile friendliness.
Auto-clear Chat Data:
Old chats automatically deleted after 24 hours.
Efficient Socket.io and WebRTC Usage:
Real-time communication is scalable and performance-oriented.
8. Activity Tracking
Profile Click Tracking:
Mimic Facebook Pixel behavior:
Track which profiles get the most clicks.
Track which users are clicking on which profiles.
Data used internally to optimize auctioneer visibility or potential ranking.
App content can not be screenshot or screen recorded.
Font comic sans.
